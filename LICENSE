LFG COMMERCIAL LICENSE v1.0
===========================

Summary
-------
► **MIT licence** for ALL use on recognised public *testnets*.  
► **Commercial licence** for ANY deployment on *mainnets* or production
  networks, subject to the revenue‑share and fee‑floor terms below.

You may:
  • read, fork, and modify the code for personal or internal testing;  
  • deploy freely to testnets.

You must (when deploying on non‑testnet networks):
  • pay the Original Author **15 % of all “Fee Revenue”** (§2);  
  • keep fee `feeOnCurve` **≥ the Minimum Fee Floor** (§3);  
  • keep migration variables as they **are** (but you are allowed to change
    order, but not to Uniswap V2).

  • reproduce this licence in any redistributions.

Failure to comply **TERMINATES** this licence. Continued use constitutes
copyright infringement and may expose you to statutory damages.

1. Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“Original Author” ............................ 0x5C18eec0B15B962DAd08a4d2CBAF7C66eE98b93c 
“Fee Revenue” ...............................  Gross amount credited to
                                               the pool contract’s
                                               `feeOnCurve`
                                               and the migration variables
                                               as they are set in the pool
                                               contract on Github and on
                                               Ethereum mainnet.

“Testnet” ................................... Any network whose
                                               chain‑id is *not* listed
                                               as a production chain in
                                               EIP‑155 (e.g. Sepolia,
                                               Base Sepolia, BNB Testnet).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Revenue‑Share Obligation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployments on non‑testnet networks must route **15 % of all Fee Revenue**
to `alwaysInShare`. Altering or disabling this variable violates the
licence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Minimum Fee Floor
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• On chains where the Original Author has an official deployment, you may
  **NOT** set  
    – `feeOnCurve` lower than the current values (when reading this)
    –  and the migration values to other values. You are allowed to change
    -  the migration order, but not to Uniswap V2.

• On chains **without** an official deployment, you may **NOT** set `feeOnCurve`
  below **25 bps (0.25 %)**. The migration variables cannot be changed.
  Only the order. Uniswap V2 is not allowed.
